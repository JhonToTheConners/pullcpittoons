# pullcpittoons
Script that will pull your swgoh.gg guild's profile, then pull each guildmate's page, then look for any toon r5 and above.

**Must have git bash installed if you are on a windows computer. If you are on linux you can run the .sh files normally, but windows by default cannot do this**
**Can be downloaded here: https://git-scm.com/downloads**
**I plan on not requiring git bash in the near future, but for now it is what it is**
INSTRUCTIONS:

(1): Open pulldata.sh, change my guild's swgoh.gg page to your guild's page. 

(2): Run RUNALL.sh
